# BingTranslatorX

基于必应词典的中英互译, 支持鼠标选中/悬浮取词、英美音标及发音。基于 https://www.bing.com/dict 。

A Chrome extension for Chiese-English/English-Chinese translating. Support mouse hovering and selection.Based on https://www.bing.com/dict.

Note: Currently this extension is built on Manifest V2, however Google will stop support V2 start from 2023. I'll migrate this extension to Manifest V3 before that, hopefully with some bug fixing as well.
See [Manifest V2 support timeline](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/mv2-sunset/).
